## Antarctic Ice Sheet-Ocean Interactions

The manner in which ice sheets and ocean interact plays an important role in the global climate. In Antarctica, this interaction is primarily through enormous floating extensions of the ice sheet called ice shelves. The ocean circulates underneath the ice shelves leading to melting and freezing. From the ocean side, this melting and freezing changes the properties of sea water, which can ultimately have impacts on the ocean's large-scale overturning circulation.

On the ice side, the effect of melting is to thin the ice shelves. While this does not immediately contribute to sea level, it affects the buttressing capacity of the ice shelf -- its ability to hold back flow of ice from the continent into the sea. Since the mid-1990s, it is known that the ice shelves of the Amundsen Embayment of West Antarctica have been melting at high rates due to the presence of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). It is feared that the speed up of the ice, and the subsequent retreat of grounding lines in the Amundsen, will lead to a positive feedback loop often called Marine Instability -- and that sea levels will rise much faster than they do currently in the coming centuries.

Here are some helpful links explaining the above concepts:
