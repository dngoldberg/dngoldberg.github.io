## Subglacial hydrology

There is extensive water at the base of ice sheets, in some cases produced by drainage of supraglacial melt through crevasses and moulins, and in other cases generated by frictional heating and geothermal flux at the ice base. The Edinburgh Cryosphere group is a leading centre of expertise in subglacial hydrological research and I have been fortunate enough to be included in a number of exciting studies and projects.

The above image from [Tedstone et al 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15722) shows how complicated the dynamics of subglacial hydrology are. Focussing on a large, land-terminating sector in southwest Greenland, the study shows that despite supraglacial melt increases, which suggest [high speeds in the spring and summer](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/297/5579/218), annually-averaged velocity has decreased. This is because the same influx of water which leads to those high speeds causes a more efficient drainage system, which slows down the ice sheet in the late autumn and winter -- and the increased slowdown has a stronger effect.

I am very lucky to be a part of two fantastic projects focussing on subglacial hydrology. [4DAntarctica](http://4d-antarctica.org/) aims to characterise the subglacial environment of Antarctica. My role with postdoc [Dr Martin Wearing](https://martinwearing.com/) is to derive melt rates from frictional heating, which requires [inverse modelling](https://dngoldberg.github.io/inverse) to infer basal velocities and drag. By examining subglacial melt and transport at the continental scale, as well as focused studies on dynamic regions, we will construct a coherent picture of how water moves throughout the underside of the ice sheet, and how it impacts ice dynamics. A further aim is to identify subglaial processes relating to ice-ocean interactions, as [freshwater runoff provides a strong source of buoyancy to ice-shelf cavities](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JPO-D-11-03.1).

The other project is [MII-Greenland](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FS011390%2F1) which aims to develop state of the art supra- and subglacial hydrological components within the UKESM ice-sheet model [BISICLES](https://commons.lbl.gov/display/bisicles/BISICLES). The model will benefit from the adaptive mesh framework within BISICLES, allowing high resolution where needed. It has also given me an excuse to learn how to implement the governing subglacial hydrological equations. In the image below, the equations of [Hewitt et al 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X13002045) have been applied to a radially symmetric ice sheet to investigate resolution effects on channels. In the .gif, a "sheet only" version of the equations has been applied to Thwaites Glacier (but assuming a constant melt rate); the sheet evolves from an initial thickness of zero over several years.

## Ice shelves and biology

Melting of ice shelves in Antarctica is not only relevant to buttressing of ice sheets, it can also provide nutrients to primary ocean producers in nutrient-limited environments. The upper ocean on the Antarctic continental shelf is low in iron, a micronutrient vital to phytoplankton growth and fixing of atmospheric carbon. Recent studies suggest that strongly melting ice shelves in the Amundsen deliver iron to light-penetrating layers, due to the induced upwelling of Circumpolar Deep Water and due to melting of iron-rich particulate entrained in the ice sheet base.
