Here is what I spend my time on when I'm not teaching, navel-gazing, or doing things that have nothing to do with academia...

## [PROPHET](https://thwaitesglacier.org/projects/prophet) (Processes, drivers, Prediction: modeling the History and Evolution of Thwaites)

<img style="float:left; padding-right:10px"  width="100" height="100" src="https://dngoldberg.github.io/files/proj_images/Thwaites_PROPHET.jpg">

PROPHET is a jointly NSF-NERC funded project, part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. It is led by Northumbria University and University of California-Irvine, with co-investigators in Ediburgh, Grenoble and MIT. The aim of PROPHET is to predict the future evolution of Thwaites Glacier, in Western Antarctica, using state-of-the-art ice and ocean modelling informed by accurate and extensive observational data.

## QUoRUM (QUantifying and Reducing Uncertainty in Multi-Decadal Projection of Ice Sheet-Sea Level Contribution)

QUoRUM is an Edinburgh-led NERC Standard Grant devoted to characterising uncertainty in ice-sheet model projections. The uncertainty in ice-sheet models associated with initialisation, and how this uncertainty propagates within projections, is largely unconstrained and yet is a [leading source of uncertainty in century-scale Antarctic ice-sheet simulations](https://www.the-cryosphere.net/13/1441/2019/). This project makes use of sophisticated computational tools for [PDE-solving](fenicsproject.org) and [automatic differentiation](https://github.com/jrmaddison/tlm_adjoint) together with methodologies for quantifying uncertainty of parameter sets in order to quantify uncertainty in ice-sheet predictions, to understand how it grows over time, and to hopefully identify the leading sources of uncertainty to inform future observing missions.
